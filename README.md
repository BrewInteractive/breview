Breview
=======
Breview is a tool for creating web based previews for web page mockups, Flash ads, video files etc. It basically reads a manifest file (breview.json) and creates a simple page for viewing those files.

Currently it supports HTTP (files must be accessible via web) but in near future it will be able to read from SVN repos.

It's under heavy development, unfortunately not suitable for production :( We will soon add a documentation and a proper readme :)
