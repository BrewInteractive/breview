Breview
=======
Breview is a tool for creating web based previews for web page mockups, Flash ads, video files etc. It basically reads a manifest file (breview.json) and creates a simple page for viewing those files.

Currently it supports HTTP (files must be accessible on web), in near future we will add protocols like FTP and SVN.

It's under heavy development, unfortunately not suitable for production and lacks proper documentation :(
